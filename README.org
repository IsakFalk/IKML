* Implicit Kernel Meta Learning
This repository contains code and instructions for reproducing figures and
numbers for the accompanying arxiv preprint (to-be-linked-once-uploaded). It
also contains the necessary functions to generate the datasets (synthetic and
real) used in the preprint for benchmarking meta-learning algorithms and may be
of interest to the meta-learning community independently of the algorithm.

This repository is not finalized.

* Datasets
The preprint introduces two new meta-learning regression datasets
- ~Air Quality~ :: Meta-learning tasks derived from Beijing air quality timeseries data spanning a few years
- ~Gas Sensor~ :: Meta-learning tasks derived Experimental timeseries data from gas sensors
